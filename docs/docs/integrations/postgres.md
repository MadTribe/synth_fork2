:::note

Synth PostgreSQL is currently **in beta**.

:::

## Usage

`synth` can use PostgreSQL as a data source or sink. Connecting `synth` to a
PostgreSQL is as simple as specifying a URI during the `import` or `generate`
phase.

### URI format

```bash
postgres://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<schema>
```

## Import

`synth` can import directly from a PostgreSQL database and create a data model
from the database schema. During import, a new namespace will be created from
your database schema, and a collection is created for each table in a separate
JSON file.

`synth` will automatically detect things like Primary / Foreign Key constraints
at import time and update the namespace and collection to reflect them. Other
constraints such as nullability or maximum size for
`VARCHAR` fields are also detected automatically.

Finally `synth` will sample data randomly from every table in order to create a
more realistic data model by doing things like trying to infer bounds on number
ranges.

### Example Import Command

```bash
synth import --from postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/postgres my_namespace 
```

## Generate

### Example Generation Command

```bash
synth generate --to postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/ my_namespace
```
